The website's url is https://joaquimgoliveira.pt

All the files in this repository were created to personalize this website. For this site it was used a WordPress theme called shapely, from colorlib (https://colorlib.com/), and was created a child theme to personalize each page. It was also used SASS for the styling as long as other assets and some php files to manipulate the theme and have no problems each time the shapely theme is updated by its creators.
